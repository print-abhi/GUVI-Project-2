📌 Project Overview

The Online Product Sales Dashboard project is focused on developing an interactive Power BI dashboard (initially designed in Tableau but adapted for Power BI) to analyze and visualize sales and profit data across multiple dimensions such as product, region, and time.

The primary goal is to empower businesses with insights that support data-driven decision-making by exploring sales trends, profitability, and market performance across different customer segments and geographies.

The project follows a complete data analytics workflow, from data cleaning and preprocessing to dashboard creation, visualization, and presentation of insights.

🎯 Objectives

Import structured sales data and perform preprocessing using SQL and Python.

Create a calculated field for Profit = Sales – Cost to track profitability.

Develop interactive Power BI dashboards with filters, KPIs, and dynamic charts.

Identify top-performing products, seasonal sales patterns, and regional strengths.

Ensure analysis addresses ethics, fairness, and transparency in data visualization.
